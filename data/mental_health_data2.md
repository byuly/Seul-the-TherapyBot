Right now 1 in 6 workers is dealing with a mental health problem such as anxiety, depression or stress. This can stop people performing at their best. 

Organisations perform better when their staff are healthy, motivated and focused. Smart employers support employees who are experiencing mental health problems to cope and recover. The support people receive from employers is key in determining how well and how quickly they are able to get back to peak performance.

Standing by people when they experience 

a mental health problem is not only about keeping hold of a valuable staff member – 

it also sends a message about your organisation’s values. All employees need to see that their organisation lives its values and treats its people well. Trust and integrity are key drivers of engagement and organisations that support staff reap the benefits in terms of loyalty and commitment from all employees. 

We all have mental health – it moves up and down a spectrum from good to poor and it’s affected by a range of factors both in and outside of work. Starting a conversation about it doesn’t have to be difficult – we can show you how to effectively support your staff and increase employee engagement, motivation and productivity. 

This guide sets out simple, practical and inexpensive steps that any organisation can take to support staff at every stage of the mental health spectrum – whether they’re stressed or have a diagnosed mental health condition. The approaches in this guide are universal principles designed to support a diverse range of people across a range of workplaces. It looks at:

the approach to take in any particular case. Having clear policies and approaches for managing mental health helps organisations ensure consistency but in practice this may look different in different workplaces and contexts. For example small businesses may not have formal policies for every situation but they can still develop a clear positive culture and approach on mental health and communicate this clearly to staff.

Too often employees are scared to tell their manager about a mental health problem and so problems can spiral. A recent survey revealed that one in five people felt they couldn’t tell their boss if they were overly stressed at work and less than half of people diagnosed with a mental health problem had told their manager.1

Organisations need to send a clear signal 

to staff that their mental health matters and being open about it will lead to support, not discrimination. A simple way to communicate this is to explain that mental health will be treated in the same way as physical health. 

Organisations can back this commitment 

up with a clear mental health strategy 

and specific policies to ensure employees experiencing mental health problems get 

the support they need straight away. Our previous guide, How to promote wellbeing and tackle the causes of work-related mental health problems, sets out simple, practical and inexpensive steps to help you improve mental wellbeing for all staff, tackle the causes of mental health problems and boost employee engagement. 

If you take proactive steps to create a 

more open and supportive culture, over time staff should begin to feel more confident to talk to managers about their mental health. However, it’s important to remember culture change doesn’t happen overnight and the individual relationships between managers and employees are the key to getting this right. If people are able to receive support quickly, this can often help steer them away from developing a more serious problem. For this reason, it’s vital that organisations have clear, well publicised channels in place for employees to raise concerns and take positive action promptly when staff seek help.

Our previous guide highlighted key manager behaviours that help create the right culture and space for staff to be open and seek support. Managers need to be approachable and confident about mental health and should take steps to normalise conversations about mental health and encourage open dialogue. Regular one-to-one meetings and catch-

ups are a great place to ask your staff how they’re getting on and doing so regularly will help build trust and give employees a chance to raise problems at an early stage.

Resource 4:  How to support staff who are experiencing a mental health problem

Work is the most stressful factor in people’s lives2 but often people don’t feel able to ask for help when they’re struggling. This silence feeds misunderstanding and prejudice which can make it harder for people to be open. This is why it’s vital that managers routinely ask staff how they’re doing and discuss their mental health – it helps build up people’s  confidence to speak up earlier on and get the help they need sooner. 

Sometimes people can worry about how to approach a conversation about a person’s mental health but there are no special skills needed – just the ones you use every day as a people manager like common sense, empathy, being approachable and listening. If you do nothing, problems can spiral, with a negative impact for individuals and organisations. 

If you think a member of your team may be experiencing a mental health problem, you may need to take the lead and raise this with them, as people often don’t feel able to bring it up themselves. Sometimes when managers lack confidence about mental health they 

may make this conversation overly formal 

or escalate it to HR or Occupational Health straight away. However, as their manager, 

you will know your employee best and it’s important you take the lead and talk with them yourself. The way managers behave and 

the relationship they have with staff are key factors in shaping how employees respond when they’re experiencing stress and poor mental health. It’s vital that managers start this process off in a positive and supportive way. 

It needn’t be awkward or difficult – just as you would with physical health a good place to start is simply to ask someone how they’re doing. The first step is to establish open communication (which should be maintained if people take time off for sickness absence) leading to understanding and appropriate support. 

**How do I know if someone’s experiencing a mental health problem?**

You know the people in your team and you may notice changes in them. However, it’s important to remember everyone’s experience of a mental health problem is different and there may be no outward sign – this is why it’s so important to create an environment where people can be open. You should never make assumptions about people’s mental health but clues might include:

- changes in people’s behaviour or mood or how they interact with colleagues 
- changes in their work output, motivation levels and focus 
- struggling to make decisions, get organised and find solutions to problems 
- appearing tired, anxious or withdrawn and losing interest in activities and tasks they previously enjoyed
- changes in eating habits, appetite and increased smoking and drinking.

Now you’ve opened up a dialogue with 

your employee about their mental health the priority is to develop positive steps to address the key issues they’re struggling with. Clear policies on workplace adjustments are crucial to support staff to cope and recover and reduce the length of mental health related sickness absence. 

These steps are generally quite small and simple adjustments to someone’s job role 

or extra support from their manager. Often the necessary change is one of attitude, expectations or communication – rather than a major change or significant cost. However, effective steps tend to be very individual. For this reason it’s vital you have a meaningful conversation with your employee about their needs and really listen to them. 

- Be positive – focus on what employees can do, rather than what they can’t. 
- Work together and involve people in finding solutions as much as possible. 
- Remember people are often the expert when it comes to identifying the support or adjustment they need and how to manage their triggers for poor mental health. 

While voluntary and agreed adjustments are supportive, it’s important that people are not treated differently or asked to do things that others are not required to e.g. keeping extra- detailed timesheets. Being micro-managed or made to account for all of your time can be counter-productive and damage peoples’ self- esteem. It may also be discriminatory.  

In some cases people may be unable to identify appropriate adjustments themselves so you may need to try some out. The 

best approach here is to decide on positive action and regularly monitor and review this to check it’s working, further tweaking the approach if necessary. 

**Case studies – simple, practical  and inexpensive changes![](Aspose.Words.0aa1833b-c1ea-4921-90b4-6e3bcc26df68.006.png)**

Sita was experiencing anxiety and needed the reassurance of her boss regularly acknowledging her work, saying ‘thank you’ and greeting her in the morning. Otherwise she worried she’d done something wrong. 

Simon takes his lunch break in three 20-minute slots over the day to manage his mental health and take time out when he’s feeling under pressure.

Alison experienced a family bereavement and was struggling with phone calls from the public which can be challenging and emotional. A temporary adjustment was put in place so another team member could field her calls for a period until she felt able to manage external contact again. 

Some organisations have policies on 

leave of absence and extra leave to enable staff who are experiencing a personal crisis to take some time away from work. A short period of unpaid leave can be effective in supporting people experiencing situational depression – e.g. triggered by bereavement or relationship breakdown.

**Legal duties![](Aspose.Words.0aa1833b-c1ea-4921-90b4-6e3bcc26df68.007.png)**

Remember, once aware of health or disability information, employers have 

legal duties to consider making reasonable adjustments. They also have a general duty of care and responsibility for employee health and preventing personal injury. However, adjustments should be made to help all staff cope and recover, whether 

or not they have a formal diagnosis. For information about when an employer 

may have a duty to make adjustments to someone’s job role, see [Mind’s legal briefing on disability discrimination in employment. ](http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/legal-rights/disability-discrimination/)

**On-the-job support**

From time to time we all need extra practical support or reassurance from managers. This on-the-job support is often key to supporting people’s mental health by helping them cope with challenges they’re experiencing at work. If you follow the steps in the previous section you should have a positive conversation with your employee, leading to mutual agreement on key practical support measures. It’s 

vital that support measures are decided by managers and employees together as people usually know their own mental health and needs best. Other staff such as HR can also help you develop appropriate support.

The goal for managers should be to help people feel trusted and capable and provide a sense of supported empowerment. Sometimes managers can micromanage staff who are experiencing a mental health problem or take away all challenging and meaningful work responsibilities from them. This can often be counter-productive because if people don’t feel their work is meaningful they can lose motivation. Self-esteem and anxiety issues can also be exacerbated when people feel their abilities aren’t being trusted. 

On the other hand employees don’t want their manager to be distant when they’re struggling. Managers should continue to give employees work that is challenging and engaging but at the same time it’s important to be there to offer support. The only way to get the balance right is to maintain regular communication, keep asking people what works for them and tweaking your level of support and involvement in response. 

It’s also important that all staff are trained in issues relating to mental health so employees who have mental health difficulties do not experience prejudice or discrimination and are appreciated for the contribution they make in the workplace. In some cases an independent support worker may also help support staff.

**Example of on-the-job support![](Aspose.Words.0aa1833b-c1ea-4921-90b4-6e3bcc26df68.008.png)**

When people feel under pressure they 

can find it hard to prioritise their workload. Flexible working hours and increased one- to-one supervision can help people better manage their time and plan and prioritise. Some people find a regular surgery-style trouble-shooting session with their manager helpful. You can go through the person’s to-do-list together to coach them on how 

to approach challenging tasks. This can act as a useful pressure valve to help people regain confidence and cope with challenges. 

**Other forms of support**

Not all support comes from line managers or HR. Our guide, How to promote wellbeing and tackle the causes of work-related mental health problems, has lots of useful ideas about workplace policies and initiatives that promote positive working relationships and help colleagues support one another. Peer support, buddy systems and mentoring, staff forums, diversity networks and mental health 

9![ref1]
Resource 4:  How to support staff who are experiencing a mental health problem

and other support groups can all support good staff mental health in this way. 

**Developing an action plan**

Organisations should support managers to work together with staff to develop a personal action plan to proactively manage their mental health. This allows people to plan in advance and develop tailored support for a time when they’re not coping so well. It also facilitates open dialogue with managers – leading to practical, agreed steps which can form the basis for regular monitoring and review. An action plan should cover:

- symptoms, early warning signs and triggers 
- potential impact of people’s mental health problem on their performance 

**Case study: simple changes**

Chloe was experiencing depression. Fearing the worst, she disclosed her condition but found that her boss did everything to support her by offering:![](Aspose.Words.0aa1833b-c1ea-4921-90b4-6e3bcc26df68.009.png)

- weekly catch ups to prioritise her workload
- flexible working
- afternoon naps to cope with the side effects of medication.

This aided Chloe’s speedy recovery and ability to stay in work.

4. How to manage an employee’s time off sick and their return to work

11![ref1]
Resource 4:  How to support staff who are experiencing a mental health problem

Sometimes an employee may be so unwell they need time off work to recover. The way organisations manage a period of sickness absence is key in shaping how well and how quickly people are able to return to work and get back to peak performance. To effectively support staff to recover and return to work as quickly as possible employers should: 

- be proactive and get involved as early as possible if someone is unwell
- take a person centred approach and be sensitive to the individual’s needs 
- be positive, professional and supportive throughout the process
- maintain contact with people throughout their sickness absence.

Organisations and managers should refer to the ten steps outlined in section two to shape a supportive approach to a member of staff who is off sick. Early intervention is vital – employees’ mental health problems are much more likely to become recurrent or long-term if not addressed promptly, with a negative impact for the individual and the organisation. 

It’s important to keep lines of communication open. Managers sometimes lack confidence or worry about doing or saying the wrong thing. As a result they can be reticent about maintaining contact with staff, but it’s vitally important they do so. Some organisations provide role play scenario training to build 

managers confidence so they can proactively manage these conversations in a way that leads to greater understanding and support. 

Organisations will have policies on sickness absence and return to work. These should make it clear people must be treated equally whether their sickness absence is for a mental health or physical health problem. Organisations should support managers in this – for example HR can provide advice and support about how best to maintain contact during an employee’s sickness absence 

so managers can positively manage their smooth return to work. If the relationship has broken down with the manager, make sure the person leading the contact is someone who knows the employee and has a good relationship with them. 

The way employers manage a period of sickness absence also sends a message about the organisation’s values that has a wider impact than simply on the individual. Trust and integrity are key drivers of engagement and organisations that support staff reap the benefits in terms of loyalty and commitment from all employees. If sickness absence is managed poorly, the relationship between employee and employer can break down. In some cases people may lose confidence to return to work – leading to the loss of a valuable member of staff and damaging morale across the organisation.

**Preparing for an employee’s return  to work** 

When people are ready to return to work managers should arrange to meet up in a neutral comfortable venue to catch up and discuss the details of their return together. 

An effective return-to-work interview is vital to build trust and engagement with the employee and support their smooth and sustainable return to work. By following 

the key principles outlined in section two 

you should have a productive conversation leading to a return-to-work plan that identifies positive steps to support their return. 

If the person is not yet open about their mental health, the interview is a great opportunity to explore with them what factors are contributing to their absence and to identify if they have an underlying mental health problem.

**Tips for the return-to-work  interview ![](Aspose.Words.0aa1833b-c1ea-4921-90b4-6e3bcc26df68.011.png)**

- Tell people they were missed 
- Explain the return-to-work process/ procedures
- Reassure people they are not expected to walk straight back into full time hours or to manage a full-time workload
- Ask the employee how they’re feeling
- Use open questions that require more than just a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer and give people lots of space and time to talk
- Listen and try to empathise with the employee
- Ask if there are any problems at work that might be causing them stress
- Ask if there are difficulties outside work that might be contributing to their absence
- Discuss the person’s mental health problem and the possible impact on their work
- Discuss possible solutions and ensure you are aware of sources of available support
- Discuss any worries the person has about returning to work, reassure them that this is normal and agree a strategy to address these concerns together
- Try to prepare people for how they may feel on their return and also to think about how they want to manage their return e.g. what they want to say to colleagues
- Understand that despite looking fine, someone may still be unwell.

**Return-to-work plan**

It’s absolutely vital an employee’s return to work is managed well. If it’s too pressurised or overwhelming, there is a risk they may find it stressful and may then go on sick leave again. A return-to-work plan is a key tool to help you manage this process. It should address the person’s health needs and ensure their return to work is supported through appropriate agreed steps (outlined in section three) for employees and managers to take. This may include: 

- practical steps and workplace adjustments
- on-the-job support from line manager and HR
- other forms of support such as peer support.

Discussing these steps in advance with people and producing a written plan together will help reassure people their needs will be met on their return. Doing so helps managers and employees to identify what is expected of each person and to reduce anxieties either person may have. Having a written plan also helps you to monitor and review the approach and actions you’ve each committed to – in order to check they are working as intended. If not, further alterations can be discussed. 

**The first day back at work**

The first day back at work is very important. Managers should try to make this as smooth as possible. People can often feel anxious about returning to work. They may feel self- conscious about something that happened before they went off sick or feel they’ve let colleagues down. You should decide together beforehand what colleagues will be told. People may like to be met at the door or to travel in together. Managers may also want to check that the employee has plans for lunch – possibly with a colleague they are close to.

Resource 4:  How to support staff who are experiencing a mental health problem

**How to help employees plan to stay well**

Once people are well, it can be easy to forget what they’ve learned about factors that affect their mental health. However, it’s vital to help people reflect on this and develop a plan to promote positive, healthy behaviours.

Counsellors often suggest that people produce a plan that outlines their triggers and signs. 

Signs might include things like smoking, not looking after yourself, working long hours, stopping seeing your friends, stopping exercising or eating poorly. Keeping an up- to-date action plan (see section 3) can help people to monitor their mental health when they return to work and take necessary practical steps to minimise the possibility of poor mental health developing once again.
