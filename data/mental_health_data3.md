Introduction  ![ref2]

When you first realize that someone you are close to may have a  mental illness, it can be a chaotic and frightening time. You fear  where this may lead. Suddenly you are called upon to provide   special support for which you feel completely unprepared. What  can you do? Who can you talk to?  

If you re in this situation, this guide is for you. It gives information  and advice from others who have been through your experience.  

If you re reading this in an emergency, turn to the first section  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.006.png)(page 5).  

When you have time, the rest of this guide will help you under- stand what s going on and suggest what you can do to help both  the ill person and yourself. This guide passes on the advice of   doctors, mental health professionals, and people who have been in  the role of a companion, as you now may be.   

We use the word companion to refer to the friend, family member,  or co-worker who is there with someone at the start of a mental  illness. A companion is different from a  caregiver.  That much  broader term also includes many kinds of highly experienced care  providers and trained professionals. A companion, for us, is an  ordinary person who is plunged into a bewildering and sometimes  frightening situation and wants to know how to help. This guide  shows how a companion of a person with mental illness can play an  important role, one which is increasingly appreciated by health care  professionals.

How this guide is organized![ref1]

There are two introductory sections: 

In an Emergency: what to expect and do in getting emergency help. 

About Mental Illness: questions and answers about mental illness and a companion s role.

Then three sections outline the key ways you can contribute: Helping the System Work: how you can work with the medical 

system to make the treatment effective. 

Coping at Home and Work: ways to create a supportive environ- ment to foster healing. 

Finding Other Resources: how to get connected to local health care resources. 

A crucial section emphasizes the need to keep yourself healthy: Caring for Yourself: special steps to avoid burnout and remain an 

effective companion. 

A final section covers topics a companion needs to know about:

In Focus: who does what in mental health care; stigma, fear, and discrimination; hospitalization; attempted suicide; patient s rights; medications and side effects; and relapses.

For More Information: websites and print sources. An Afterword. 

In an Emergency ![ref3]![ref2]

Going to a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital  emergency room. 

You have come with the ill person to seek emergency medical help  because of a crisis (a panic attack, a collapse, a threat of suicide,  sudden bizarre or dangerous behaviour, hearing voices, etc.). 

Here s what will happen: 

- The “triage” desk may decide other cases are more urgent, so be  prepared to wait. 
- Very likely the doctor or psychiatric nurse will take the ill person  off to be assessed. 
- You may or may not be interviewed independently. If you are  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.008.png)interviewed by a doctor or a member of the psychiatric team, you  will have an opportunity to give background information and to  ask questions.  

Whether or not you are interviewed, here s what you can do while  sitting in the waiting room:  

Giving background information 

Note down in a few sentences or points the key things you think  the doctor should know in order to fully understand the situation.  This message serves two purposes. It focuses your mind, which will  help you steady yourself. And it gives you a way to leave informa- tion that will be read by the doctor and can be put into the medical  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.009.png)

file. *The companion*  

*should insist on*   Some points to include are: *being interviewed.*  

- Your name, relationship to the ill person, phone number, etc.  **A PSYCHIATRIC NURSE** 
- Things you’ve seen that concern you. 
- Changes you may have recently noticed in the ill person’s   behaviour. 
- Whether they have mentioned feeling depressed or suicidal. 
- What was happening before the breakdown – did anything seem  to trigger it? 
- Whether the ill person has been taking other medications or  over-the-counter herbal preparations (such as St John s Wort). 

Present this list when the doctor or nurse brings the ill person back to you and ask that it be included in the medical file. ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.010.png)![ref1]

Do not expect to learn details of the mental health assessment. Medical personnel are prevented by professional codes of conduct, and sometimes by law, from divulging such information. Moreover, they are still investigating and do not want to mislead. 

At this early point, don t withhold information because you feel it might be embarrassing. The more information available at the  beginning, the better the doctor s assessment can be. Strange behav- iours are the result of the illness. They do not reflect on the person s character. Later, you may work out a companion s loyalty policy. (See Coping at Home and Work, page 16.) ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.011.png)

Questions at discharge 

Patients are usually discharged within a few hours. If they ve been sedated, they may be kept overnight. (If the patient is kept, see Hospitalization, page 33, and Patient s rights, page 35.) 

Discharge is likely to be a hurried and anxious time, but it usually gives you an opportunity to meet with medical staff and ask ques- tions. 

Care questions

Here are some questions you might ask to help you feel more  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.012.png)

` `*It s reasonable to*  confident about taking the person home: 

*ask the Emergency*  • Can the ill person be left alone? If there has been talk of suicide *Room Psychiatric*  or self-destructive behaviour, be sure the discharging doctor is *Team questions on*  aware of this. (You may have noted it in your comments, but *discharge.*  they may not have been read yet.) 

`  `**A DOCTOR** • If a medication is prescribed, what are the instructions, dosages, 

limits and possible side effects. How flexible is timing?

- Under what circumstances should the ill person be brought back? What are the danger signals? 
- As backup, what doctor or agency (name and phone number) should be called if something happens before the next appoint- ment? Is there a crisis line to call?

  Advocacy questions 

  The vast health care system often overlooks the many cracks into which a person with mental illness can fall. You, as a companion, can** help keep track of arrangements: confirming appointments, making sure all parties are contacted, documents received, etc.

**I N  A N  E M E R G E N C Y** 7 

A patient being discharged from a hospital or emergency room is  ![ref3]![ref2]in fact being formally transferred into the care of a physician (who  may or may not be the ill person s family doctor). This doctor will  use the medical file compiled at the hospital in forming a treatment  plan or referring the patient to a specialist. At discharge, therefore,  the following questions might be important to ask:  

- What is the name and phone number of the receiving physician?  Who will inform the ill person s family doctor?  
- Has an appointment been made? If so, at what time? If not, who  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.013.png)is to make the appointment? (This may be you.) *What the companion*  
- Is there a recommendation to refer the ill person to a specialist?   *says to the patient has*  If so, what is the name and phone number of the specialist?  *a huge effect. Support*  
- To whom will the medical file be sent? Has this been arranged?  *what the doctors said*  
- Who will be responsible for developing the treatment plan?  *on discharge: take your  meds, try to eat well,*  
- If the ill person is referred to a mental health team, what is the  *etc.*  

  team s phone number? 

`  `**A DOCTOR** 

There may be other questions that pertain to your situation, but  

these are a start. 

If the ill person doesn’t live with you  

If the illness has been a long time in coming, housekeeping duties  may have been neglected. Ask the ill person for keys to the house  or apartment and make arrangements for cleaning and delivery of  food if necessary. In the short term, pets need food and exercise,  plants need watering, and bills need paying. If the illness persists,  make sure someone is responsible for these tasks if the ill person is  not. It may also be a good idea to remove unneeded pills or medi- cations from the medicine cabinet.  

Community agencies that provide care services in the home (nurs- ing care, occupational therapists, homemakers) are available in  most urban settings and can be accessed through a referral by a  family physician, hospital emergency room, or in-patient unit. Ask  on discharge if such a referral has been made.

About Mental Illness![ref1]

Basic questions about mental illness and the role of the companion.

Is it mental illness?![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.014.png)

Mental illness sometimes comes on so gradually that it goes  unrecognized for a long time. The ill person, in secret fear and denial, may go to great lengths to hide their feelings or unusual behaviours. They may  self-medicate,  using alcohol or recreational drugs. Or they may slowly withdraw from the world. Someone noticing odd or anti-social behaviours may just chalk them up to personality issues, temporarily high levels of stress, or the effects of drugs or alcohol. The ill person may prefer these opinions to the truth. But trying to ignore or hide a mental illness doesn t make it go away and may only make it worse. 

At some point, however, some dramatic event may happen that cannot be ignored. It may be bizarre behaviour, a panic attack, or a suicide threat. Whatever form it takes, it finally raises the question: is a mental illness involved? This moment can be a critical one. For the ill person it may expose a secret fear. For a partner or family member it presents frightening issues: Will the ill person be okay? How am I going to look after them? Is my life going to change? And yet, accepting the possibility of a mental illness is an essential first step toward better mental health.

Of course it may not be mental illness after all. There are sev-

eral physical conditions, such as hormonal disorders (including thyroid), liver disorders, and substance abuse that can bring on symptoms and behaviours resembling a mental illness. Then, too, bouts of mental illness differ greatly in kind, severity, length, and likelihood of recurrence. However, if a mental illness is involved, the sooner this fact is recognized and the illness is identified, the sooner the ill person will find relief and the easier the illness will be to manage and recover from. 

Does the kind of mental illness matter to the companion? 

Initially, a lot of attention is focused on  getting a diagnosis.  In fact, there are hundreds of possible specific diagnoses of mental illness, falling in several broad categories. In some cases it is clear 

8 **A B O U T  M E N T A L  I L L N E S S**


![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.015.png)

which illness a person has. In other cases, a seriously ill person may,  ![ref4]over a period of years, receive a succession of differing diagnoses.  These diagnoses are important to the doctors and the health care  system because they determine the treatments that are most likely  to work. But they matter surprisingly little to the kinds of support  needed from the companion.  

The companion s role is determined more by their relationship to,  and the attitude of, the ill person, the degree of basic home care  needed, school or work problems, isolation, shame and secrecy,  threats of suicide, fears of persecution, etc. These are the things  that really decide how the companion helps the ill person to man- age. From a companion s point of view, the medical term for the  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.017.png)illness is a side issue. Long-term companions often say that diagno- *We didn t want the* ses come and go. *diagnosis to be true.* 

Once a diagnosis has been made, the person may allow the illness 

to take over their identity: as in  now I m a schizophrenic.  The   **A PMENTERSON AL ILLNESSWITH A** companion can help counter such thoughts by focusing on the 

ill person s continued uniqueness, goals, and daily life. This helps 

to bolster the person s sense of self-respect as someone who has a 

meaningful life that, at present, includes an illness.

Does diagnosis of a mental illness mean a  loss of control over one’s life? 

Some people fear that, if they are *diagnosed* with a mental illness,  bad things will happen to them. So they are reluctant to seek help.  

Losing control is one of the great fears of a person facing mental  illness. There are two aspects to this fear: internal and external.  Internally, the ill person fears a loss of self due to the effects of the  illness. Externally, the ill person fears that the medical system will  somehow take over treatment against their will.  

Internally, a person s loss of control is what happens because of the illness itself, not because of treatment. Avoiding assessment and diagnosis simply allows a mental illness to develop unchecked. If an illness is present, then a diagnosis is the first step towards ![ref1]*regaining* control because it opens the door to treatment. In this way, mental illness is just like any physical illness.


` `*It s so hard not to think: Why can t you pull out of this?  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.018.png)*

`  `**A COMPANION**

![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.019.png)

` `*I wish we d had an antidote to the feeling that it was our fault.*  

`  `**A PARENT**

Externally, the fear is that a diagnosis of mental illness will bring a cascade of undesirable and uncontrollable consequences. It used to be that the treatment of choice for people with a mental illness was enforced hospitalization and treatment. But that approach has been replaced by a modern, more voluntary approach. In addition, there are several specific criteria (these vary by province) that qualified doctors must satisfy in order to determine whether an ill person can be hospitalized against their will. A hospitalized patient always has the right to appeal and to receive legal advice. (See Patient s rights, page 35.) 

Many factors have caused this change: the emergence of effective new self-administered drugs, an appreciation of the therapeutic value of a home environment and independent living, and the  rising costs of hospitalization, among other things. The result is that many people with a mental illness spend most of the time try- ing to fend for themselves. Instead of fearing that  the system will do something bad to me,  the real risk is that someone with a  mental illness  won t get the help I need.  

Does mental illness indicate a personal failure of some kind? 

People once tended to blame the ill person or their parents for a mental illness. But our growing understanding of mental illness indicates an almost universal involvement of factors over which we have no control, such as biochemical imbalance and genetic influ- ences. Increasingly, mental illness seems to be a physical illness that disrupts brain processes. 

And yet, even knowing it isn t their fault, people with a mental  illness often feel a sense of failure and humiliation. In part, this may come as a response to outmoded social attitudes, such as rec- ommendations to  buck up and get yourself in order  (which is like asking someone with a broken leg to  stand up and walk ). A sense of failure may also come from feelings of inadequacy in man- aging the illness or a repeated inability to meet short-term goals or follow treatment instructions. Often a person with mental illness needs help overcoming this unfair and unnecessary self-criticism. 

**A B O U T  M E N T A L  I L L N E S S**


Mental illness, if it appears, is not something that could have been  ![ref4]avoided. When certain strange symptoms or behaviour turn out to  have been signs of a mental illness, there is a tendency to wonder  

` `what if I d realized sooner.  But there s no point in second guess- ing yourself, as if the illness could have been foreseen and somehow  prevented. The important thing is that it has been discovered now  rather than some time later when it has gotten worse. Acceptance  of the presence of mental illness, whenever it is discovered, is an  important and wise move. It makes it possible to move ahead to  diagnosis, treatment, management, and recovery.  

**A B O U T  M E N T A L  I L L N E S S** 15

Why is support important for someone with a mental illness? 

The health care system can provide essential treatment for the disease. But with mental illness, treatment is only part of what s important. Help with the management of one s daily life is also needed. While medical treatment focuses on the illness, the com- panion helps focus on the person. Managing one s life during a bout of mental illness and a variety of treatments often requires more personal resources than an ill person can muster. 

People with a mental illness are required to seek resources for them- selves, to be informed health consumers, at a period in their lives when they are least able to do so. That is why the success of an ill person s efforts to cope with the symptoms and keep on track to recovery may depend on support. A companion is well placed to offer that support.  

Here are some crucial things a companion can do that the health care system cannot do: 

- support the treatment plan by following instructions, observing, and providing information.
- maintain a healing home environment adapted to the ill person’s personality and situation. 
- act as an “informed consumer” of mental health resources in the community.

   *Remember, doctors are concerned about the disease. You re concerned about the person.* 

  `  `**A DOCTOR![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.020.png)**

` `*A companion s role* 

*is to turn a seemingly unmanageable situation into something manageable.* 

` `**A DOCTOR**

**A B O U T  M E N T A L  I L L N E S S** 

It s easy to see how these strategies may well be beyond the capacity of a person struggling with mental illness. 

Episodes and interludes 

A mental illness often features a series of acute episodes separated by relatively peaceful interludes. (See Relapses, page 37.) A pattern of waxing and waning can recur without apparent reason or cause. 

**A B O U T  M E N T A L  I L L N E S S** 16

Such a pattern, if recognized, can be used to help both treatment and life management. But in the early stages such cycling, if not ![ref1]![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.021.png)

` `*One psychiatrist*  understood, can cause misleading expectations. For example, as an *said to my partner:*  acute episode recedes, the ill person may mistakenly believe they 

` `*You are no longer*  are cured and stop taking their medication. In another case, after 

*ill. You are in*  a healthy, peaceful interlude, when a relapse occurs, the ill person *recovery.  That*  may collapse into disappointment and despair. 

*was a very helpful,*  In these situations, a companion can keep things stabilized by *positive statement*  consciously thinking and talking  against the cycle.  For example, *for me.*  during an acute episode, a companion can keep reminding the ill 

person that there is a cycle and things will get better. As the person   **A COMPANION** starts to improve, a companion will not think the illness has been 

beaten. If a relapse begins, they can be ready for it. (See “Ulysses 

agreement,  page 19.) 

In general, recovery from a mental illness does not occur suddenly once and for all but rather over time as the acute episodes become less frequent and less severe.

Helping the System Work ![ref4]

You can help make the treatment plan effective. 

Getting to a doctor 

This guide begins with instructions on how to deal with a crisis  that is severe enough to send you to the hospital or doctor s office.  But not all mental illnesses first appear so dramatically. Sometimes  a mental illness only gradually shows itself. As it develops, it brings  changes in behaviour, attitude, energy level, sleep patterns, appetite,  and so on. At first, these changes may be barely noticeable to you  as a friend, family member, or co-worker. But as they develop you  may become increasingly concerned and want to encourage a visit  to the doctor in order to get a professional opinion on what the full  range of signs and symptoms might mean.  

It may take a great deal of coaxing to get someone to go to the doc- tor, but the effort is worth making. You could offer to help compile a list of the symptoms. A person in distress who rejects any idea of mental illness might still be persuaded to visit a doctor at least to rule out a physical illness   such as thyroid or liver malfunction, or the effects of medication interactions or substance abuse. You could offer to go with them as moral support.

Following instructions

If there is a specific diagnosis, the doctor will draw up a treatment plan that will likely include medication. Out-patient treatment leaves it up to patients to fill the prescription and follow instruc- tions. They may not do this very well. They may forget their pills. They may ignore recommendations on nutrition, sleep, substances (smoking, alcohol, drugs), and so on. Sometimes there are reasons. But other times it s all just too much to cope with. The problem with such behaviour (which doctors call non-adherence or non- compliance) is that it undermines treatment. 

 *I consider a companion to be my patient s spare brain. The brains of my mentally ill patients can be so kerfuffled, they need someone with them who can keep things on track.*  

`  `**A DOCTOR ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.022.png)**

If you live with the ill person and see they need help following in-

![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.023.png)

**H E L P I N G  T H E  S Y S T E M  W O R K** 13

structions, do what you can: arrange pills to make them easier to remember, have regular mealtimes and bedtimes, offer to go for walks, etc. This is an area of treatment where a companion can be ![ref1]

a real ally. Offer encouragement and hope for the treatment plan. Keep reaffirming the basic instructions that were set out when you left the hospital or doctor s office. Give the treatment plan a chance to work.

Promoting information flow

Don’t expect to receive much medical information 

Once the ill person goes to the doctor, or emergency room, don t expect to be included in the diagnostic process. At the beginning ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.024.png)

` `*There may be times*  and throughout treatment, medical personnel may tell you little, if *when you feel like*  anything, about diagnoses and case details. This is one of the things *you re the only one*  companions find most frustrating about mental illness. But doctors *talking. The doctors*  are prevented by ethics or law from sharing medical findings with-

out the explicit consent of the ill person. Moreover, they don t want *aren t saying much, the*  to make misleading comments while they pursue their investiga-

*ill person isn t saying*  tions. 

*much, their workplace* 

*or school isn t calling,*  Providing information 

*and family and friends,*  As much as possible, try to make sure that the various specialists 

*not knowing what to*  involved in the treatment plan are kept informed of the condition *say, are quiet too. This*  of the ill person. At a time when you feel no one is telling you any- *can be a lonely time,*  thing, this can feel strange. But it allows you to keep open the lines *but it doesn t have to*  of communication and to keep the members of the treatment team *be.*   reminded of your case. In doing this it is especially important for the   **A COMPANION** sake of the ill person to try to maintain respectful and cordial rela-

tions with all the team members. 

Why the information is important 

During hospitalization, a patient is closely observed and interviewed by a variety of specialists, who pool their information daily. This wealth of information speeds up assessment and treatment and is one of the main reasons for hospital stays. ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.025.png)

With people who visit for appointments, however, the doctor has much less information to go on: not much more than current  observations and the ill person s comments. But how an ill person behaves during a half-hour appointment can be dramatically dif- ferent from how they behave at home. As well, a person who is mentally ill can be forgetful and unable to think clearly or even to describe their symptoms during an appointment. And sometimes it takes an observer to notice the effects when medication dosages 

14 **H E L P I N G  T H E  S Y S T E M  W O R K**

are being adjusted. You can reduce this information gap by help- ![ref4]ing to write down a list of observations for the ill person to take to  the doctor s appointment. This kind of ongoing medical history is  a good substitute for the regular observational charts available in a  hospital setting.  

What kinds of information are needed? 

In general there are two kinds of relevant observations: 

- Symptoms: hallucinations, reactions, etc. that only the ill person knows.
- Signs: behaviour patterns, changes, etc. that the companion can notice. 

Because every case is unique, the doctor will focus on particular  issues of concern. By checking with the doctor what to watch for and record, you can become a valuable partner in the treatment team. Sometimes this record reveals behavioural patterns a doctor might not notice during a brief appointment. 

Ideally, you and the ill person work together on describing things that occur between doctor s appointments. When this is not pos- sible, you can seek the ill person s consent to keep such a record, agreeing not to show it to the doctor without permission. With the doctor s support, you may then be able to convince the ill person of the value of this record. Don t trust things to memory. Write down your observations, noting the date and time. The doctor will help you fine tune your observations, so you should start by including even things that may seem irrelevant or not really worth noting. 

Frustrations 

From time to time you may be frustrated and annoyed in dealing with the health care system. Almost everyone has these experiences, including the professionals working within it. Branches may be un- derstaffed, people may face impossible demands and deadlines, an- ger from a previous encounter may be taken out on you in short, the indignities that occur in large organizations may not always spare you. The health care system has its share of modern institu- tional problems and it s hard to avoid contact with the frictions and tensions inherent in a highly stressed and busily operating system. 

It helps to remember that you are there not for yourself but on someone else s behalf. You do not want disputes arising from your own feelings, however justified, to interfere with the treatment be- ing given to another person. So even if you feel provoked by some- thing, try to keep your temper and remain tolerant while still advo- cating on behalf of the ill person. And never give up.

Coping at Home and Work ![ref5]

You can help promote management and  recovery.

Perhaps one of the hardest things to do when someone is struck with mental illness is to keep things feeling  normal  at their home. ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.029.png)

` `*Do all you can*  Depending on your relationship with the ill person, you ll be able *to reinforce the*  to do more or less in terms of creating a safe and healing environ- *patient s dignity.*   ment. But no matter how close you are to the person, there are 

`  `**A DOCTOR** ways to try to ensure that the interactions you have with each other 

are as easy and satisfying as possible for both of you.

Psychological barriers 

Mental illness tends to create psychological barriers that make  normal social interactions almost impossible. These include: ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.030.png)

- Isolation: People may be put off by behaviour that seems eccen- tric, rude, or withdrawn. As friends and co-workers drop away, the ill person is left in solitude. 
- Shame: Fear of losing face may spur an obsession with secrecy and with controlling who and what can be told. Much energy may go to keeping up a false front and trying to appear normal. 
- Anxiety: Mental illness is surrounded by fears: about loss of self, about the future, about treatment methods. Sometimes there is also paranoia about being watched, singled out, or pursued.  
- Lethargy: Both illness and medications may result in an over-

`  `*I did nothing for*  whelming fatigue. Even talking on the phone or sitting up 

*a year and yet my*  straight may seem too much. Lying on the couch may be all the *mind was never so*  ill person can manage.

*busy.*  

- Confusion: The effects of the illness or of the medications may 

`  `**A FORMERLY ILL**  make it difficult for the ill person to think. They may find it hard **PERSON** to understand what they hear or to express themselves clearly.

- Delusions and hallucinations: The ill person may be preoccupied with a world that includes  breaks from reality,  such as unreal thoughts, voices, etc. This struggle may interfere with normal  human interactions.

  During these times you can help mediate and smooth relations be- tween the ill person and the rest of the world. 

Healing interactions  ![ref2]

Sometimes, when a mental illness occurs, the personality of the  

ill person may change. This is upsetting in part because it seems  inexplicable. For example, their looks haven t changed so why are  they behaving so differently? The emerging odd behaviours can  seem amusing or haunting or frightening. It helps to understand  that these behaviours are involuntary responses to a titanic inner  struggle and reactions to things you can t see or feel. As your expec- tations adjust to this new understanding, it becomes easier to relate  to the somewhat different person. 

Generally, experienced companions advise making special efforts  to be calm and reasonable and to avoid being provoked. Wherever  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.031.png)possible, it helps to be:  *Don t take away*

- Sympathetic: respect the ill person’s struggle to cope with daunt- *reinforce their inability* ing internal psychological challenges. Recognize that fears, voices,  *to do things. Give* etc. are very real to the ill person. Appreciate the anger, frustra- *them ownership and* tion, and embarrassment being experienced. *responsibility where* 
- Reliable: be readily available and a calm presence. Recognize that  *possible.*  

  some questions do not call for answers and that being nearby   **A DOCTOR**

  through everything may be what s really wanted.

- Consistent: use your judgment to decide which few things are  important enough to be consistently firm about, such as taking  medications.   
- Amenable: allow the ill person to set the pace, choose activities,  and make their own comforts; do things  with  rather than  for   the ill person. Encourage them to make decisions. 
- Optimistic: look ahead to recovery and building a new kind of  life rather than talking about returning to the way of living as- sociated with the illness. Maintaining a forward-looking attitude  can be difficult, yet it is liberating when real changes have to be  *Don t say:  Buck* made. Hope is important for everyone. *up, pull up your* Such supportive attitudes are hard to maintain in the best of cir- *socks, get some rest* cumstances, let alone in proximity to a mental illness. They can  *and you ll be better* only be goals to strive for. Even then, it is easy to see why one com- *in the morning.*  panion says it was  the hardest job I ever had.     **A DOCTOR**

There may be moments when you  lose it : break down in tears,  fall into a rage, can t help expressing a flood of emotion. This is to  be expected. (See Caring for Yourself, page 26.) Honest emotion is  something an ill person recognizes and respects. It shows you are  

a true companion, a fellow traveller, an equal person. Remember though, just as with cancer or heart disease, it s the ![ref5]*illness* that is  enraging you, not the person. It is enraging the ill person as well. 

Trust and partnership

Unlike a caregiver or medical professional, a companion may be more ready to think of the task of managing and defeating a  mental illness as a project in which they and the ill person are part- ners. This means building trust and developing partnership   and keeping them continually maintained and refreshed. Success in this area may be very limited   depending on the personality of the ill person and the severity of their illness.

` `*Whatever the relationship you have with the ill person, it s a place to start. It s the basis on which you both can work to build a closer, co-operative bond in a difficult project.  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.032.png)*

`  `**A COMPANION**

![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.033.png)

The following suggestions imply a relationship in which the ill per- son is quite co-operative, which may or may not be so in your case. But they do outline some pathways that may be useful to you.

Building trust 

Here are some ways companions build trust: 

- Listening: sympathetically and patiently listening to the ill per- son s feelings and concerns without being judgmental or critical, perhaps commenting or suggesting ways of dealing with them. 
- Respecting privacy concerns: only extending the circle of those who know about the illness, or discussing details, to the extent the ill person agrees. 
- Not going behind the ill person: trying not to talk to doctors or take actions without the knowledge and consent of the ill person. If there are times when you feel it is essential to talk to doctors or take some action despite the ill person s disagreement, you can maintain trust by explaining why you think this instance is an ex- ception and by carefully describing beforehand what you intend to do. 

Bear in mind that what works at one time may not work at another time. At some point a concern for safety might justify a breach of trust. In any case, behaving this rationally over an extended period of time, or when all else may seem completely irrational, takes skill and real strength. Some days you ll be good at it. Some days you won t. That s okay.

Developing partnership 

On the basis of trust and agreement, you can do many things with and on behalf of the ill person: 

- Attending meetings with doctors and others. 

**C O P I N G  A T  H O M E  A N D  W O R K** 27

- Asking questions and advocating.  ![ref2]
- Recording symptoms and sensations, describing behavioural   patterns and disruptions, etc.  
- Discussing strategies and making plans and arrangements. 
- Making and answering phone calls, meeting visitors, organizing  household tasks. (It may surprise you how important such help  with these seemingly easy tasks can be to a mentally ill person.) ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.034.png)These are just some of the ways you can help the ill person man- *What I m learning* age and work around the psychological barriers that block access to  *is that the trick is* friends and community.  *to be with and for the person, not AT* A “Ulysses agreement”  *them.*  

This strategy is named for an incident in Homer s *Odyssey*. Ulysses   **A COMPANION** had to captain his ship past the coast of the Sirens, sea-nymphs 

whose song charmed all sailors hearing it to throw themselves in 

the water and drown. But Ulysses wanted to hear the song himself. 

His solution was to make his crew plug their ears so they would be 

safe. Then they were instructed to tie him to the mast so he could 

hear the song as they sailed by. Their agreement was that the crew 

was to refuse to release him no matter how he pleaded with them. 

After the ship had passed safely, his crew untied him. 

The idea of the Ulysses agreement is that the ill person (like  Ulysses) and the companion (like the crew) spell out *in writing* the  circumstances when the companion can overrule the ill person s  demands. For example, such a written agreement might say that if  the ill person shows certain signs or talks of suicide, the compan- ion may make decisions and take steps (for example, call for help,  go to Emergency) to keep the ill person safe. Or, the agreement  might give priority to, or exclude, certain forms of treatment. The  agreement can remain informal or be made legally binding with a  lawyer’s help. In effect, the ill person is saying, like Ulysses, “when  I can t trust myself, I can trust you to act on my behalf.   ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.035.png)

This doesn t work for everyone, but some swear by it. 

Regaining well-being  

People in good health tend to take the many aspects of  well-being for granted. But for a person with a mental ill- ness some of these aspects may have been damaged by the  illness, while others may become keys to improvement.  

The overall aspects of well-being are known to everyone:  

- Healthy living: nutrition, exercise, sleep.  
- Work: responsibilities, stresses, accomplishments, contacts.  
- Culture: recreation, friendships, interests. ![ref5]

  You and the ill person can keep these things in mind when discuss- ing strategies for healthy living. 

  These aspects of well-being are often overlooked in mental illness because they re not directly involved in treatment. However, they are *very* important to an ill person s ability to manage and recover from the effects of illness. They show one of the differences be- tween what a companion does and what a doctor does. Well-being is what the person with a mental illness needs most in the long haul, and where a companion can make a unique long-term contri- bution. 

  Tips for daily living

- Getting proper nutrition: People with a mental illness often find it difficult to eat well. They feel nauseated, food doesn t taste good, and preparing it is so much effort. So have simple, tasty foods around that they can snack on when they want. Encourage them to eat, or serve, small portions frequently throughout the day. A tin of ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.036.png)*Boost* or *Ensure*, or a milkshake with fruit in it, is also a good (and easy) supplement.
- Charting the course. Display the person’s return to health by writing a list that focuses only on the good things that happen. These can be small (patted the dog, got up for a meal, slept well) or larger (made a meal, called a friend, got dressed, went for a walk, felt interested in something). These can become important signposts for both of you.
- Asking questions. Sometimes a person with mental illness has so much going on in their head they forget to communicate out loud. Tell them you re willing to help with almost anything, but you need clues from them about what s wanted or not wanted. Some people may just want to be left alone. Others want com- panionship. You ll only know by asking. 

  Dealing with the family

  When mental illness strikes a family member, it also affects every- one else in the family, particularly those living in the same home. Other family members may feel excluded, frightened, resentful, protective, guilty   or many other reactions, all complicated by personal relationships and family dynamics. Even as you watch yourself for signs of distress, it may be a good idea to be alert to the moods of other family members, young or old. Individual or  family counselling sessions may be needed by everyone. (See Find- ing Other Resources, page 23.) 

Dealing with the workplace  ![ref2]

Mental illness at work  

When a working person enters a period of mental illness, issues  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.037.png)tend to arise involving co-workers on the shop floor or colleagues  at the office. What the issues may be in your particular case will  depend on the kind of workplace it is and the ill person s rela- 

tion to it. Sometimes a developing illness is eroding an employee s  work performance, causing friction or even threatening continued  employment. Other times an open and tolerant shop floor or of- fice will be making supportive accommodations. Very likely the ill  person has been struggling to keep the growing disability a secret in  order to maintain their status and reputation. But as the illness de- velops, it becomes harder and harder to maintain performance and  appearances. And so, the work situation is becoming intolerable.  

What to do  

As always, you as a companion should not do anything here with- out the full agreement of the ill person. In any case, you should not  attempt to be an intermediary with the workplace.  

You should be aware that, for employees still at work, many work- places have Employee Assistance Programs, which pay for several  sessions of basic counselling. Typically this service is confidential,  and the employer will not know who is using it. Increasingly, such  programs are limited to getting the employee an appropriate ex- ternal referral. Some companies have extended health care plans  which pay for a certain number of counselling sessions annually,  some counselling for family members, and other services.  

Furthermore, one of your community mental health organizations  may offer a Job Coach Program. When a person s employment is  threatened by the consequences of mental illness, such a program  can help the ill person retain their job, or take a break from it, or  even get it back.  

But if the ill person becomes incapacitated, something has to be  done to inform the workplace. The best thing to do is the simplest.  The companion calls a manager, or supervisor, or union rep, or   human resources department and says that  So and so is off for  medical reasons. We ll get you a note shortly from the doctor.   That is all. Details are left for the doctor, who is bound by limita- tions on disclosure. This leaves all options open. 

Provided the ill person is under the regular care of a physician, and  the latter sends a note periodically to the employer, nothing further  may be required.  

**C O P I N G  A T  H O M E  A N D  W O R K** 31

A companion should be aware the employee may be contractually covered by short-term or long-term disability benefits that provide rehabilitation services. If that can be established, the insurance company will pay for services to assist the employee s recovery. ![ref5]

If the ill person s absence may be lengthy, an employer usually  assigns a contact person to deal with issues such as disability  benefits or return-to-work accommodations.

Finding Other Resources ![ref4]

You can get connected to mental health  resources in your community.

Taking the initiative

Managing and recovering from a mental illness usually requires much more than passively receiving treatment as a  patient  of a specialist. People with a mental illness may benefit greatly from some of the more broadly based services available in the commu- nity, which they access as  clients  and  consumers.  These other services are often called  resources,  which means they re available to those who make the effort to search them out.  

However, a person whose usual capabilities are being undermined by a bout of mental illness may not have any idea about what might help them, let alone how to get out into the community to find it. So a companion s support may be indispensable in discover- ing the wide array of supports and services available and searching through them for what is needed.  

 *The companion needs to be entrepreneurial.*

**F I N D I N G  O T H E R  R E S O U R C E S** 

Peer support groups and personal counselling 

At certain times a person with a mental illness may need to be 

stabilized medically before being able to focus on intense personal 

issues. But when they feel ready, peer support groups and personal 

counselling can offer important benefits and insights. You may 

have to take the lead in encouraging your friend, family member, 

or co-worker to try out some of the various options locally avail-

able. (For companion support, see Caring for Yourself, page 26.) *If I am shy about* In peer support group meetings, people undergoing similar experi- *going to a new* 

ences share their stories, feelings, and strategies. The meetings are  *group and don t* friendly and non-judgmental. Often companions are also encour- *want to meet people s* aged to attend. *eyes, I bring my* 

Other people with a mental illness prefer one-on-one counselling  *knitting.* 

with a clinical psychologist or trained psychotherapist. There s     **A COMPANION** every reason to try different types of services. 

If cost is a factor: Support groups tend to be made available through hospital departments or community organizations at little or no cost to participants. Individual counselling usually has to 

be paid for, though some assistance may be available through the 

**F I N D I N G  O T H E R  R E S O U R C E S** 34

health care system or from psychologists or clinical counsellors who offer sliding fee scales.![ref1]

If time is a factor: There may be delays in getting appointments with a counsellor, whereas support groups usually hold regular meetings. ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.040.png)

`  `**A COMPANION** persistence. You can help by making contacts, arranging interviews, 

providing companionship at meetings, driving to the counsellors, and sometimes even talking about the experiences later. Note that counselling or psychotherapy may be covered by employee assis- tance plans or insurance.

Some tips 

- Many communities have handbooks or websites of organizations and professionals providing services of all kinds for persons with mental illness. Check the local library.
- Associations and organizations share and distribute one another’s brochures.

- Members of a peer support group can share a wealth of informa- ![ref4]tion and experiences on local professionals, organizations, medi- cations, etc.  

In-depth information 

**F I N D I N G  O T H E R  R E S O U R C E S** 37

Many ill persons and their companions (though not all) are eager to find out more about mental illness, particularly diagnoses, health care issues, caregiver resources, and so on. Apart from what can be easily found in a good bookstore or library, two additional sources should be mentioned: 

- Reference librarians. Larger libraries and specialty medical librar- ies have librarians with a vast knowledge of sources that might be of interest to you and ways to find them. 
- The Internet: There is a huge and growing array of websites  devoted to every aspect of mental illness and its treatment and management. (See For More Information, page 39.) If you don t know how to use a computer, you can be easily coached by a li- brarian on how to find these sites using the Internet access that is now available in public libraries. Internet users always have to be aware that information on websites is not necessarily accurate or medically valid.  

Some companions find that once there is a diagnosis, they benefit from reading up about the illness. For them, part of the fear and confusion stems from not knowing about the nature of the illness, what can be expected and what to watch out for. Others prefer to learn from their experiences, gathering information only as they need it. There is no right or wrong way to proceed. 

Whatever the approach, a companion to a person with a mental illness always gains a much broader and deeper understanding of mental illness and what can be done for it.

Caring for Yourself![ref5]

To avoid burnout and remain an effective companion you need to take special steps.

Keeping your independence

To be an effective partner, keep your own life going. Some com-

panions find this difficult to do at first. They feel guilt-ridden at 

having a good time with friends, or going off on their own even for ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.043.png) *A companion has to*  a few hours. A mental illness tends to create a psychological bubble 

that has a powerful tendency to envelop you too. Resist it. Much of *consider where his or*  your value to the ill person comes from maintaining your indepen-

*her boundaries are.*  dence of thought and action. 

*Know yourself.* 

The self-absorption of mental illness can sometimes make the  

`  `**A DOCTOR** sufferer seem both sullen and unresponsive to your suggestions and 

yet wily, manipulative, and quite ruthless at getting their own way. If you keep independently connected to the world at large, you ll find it easier to keep your good judgment and your own under- standing of what is going on. An ill person depends on you for this. Even if they seem to be trying to undermine you, they want you to remain your own person. 

In particular you can be of most help by remaining positive and optimistic   even through times when you feel as if everything you say and do is wrong. Here s where noticing things about the situa-

` `*The states of mind*  tion that strike you as funny can help you forge ahead. A big part 

of your job as companion is to hang on to a sense of hope for both *of companions*  of you, through everything. That s why you need to keep your own

`  `**A DOCTOR** Spouses, family members, friends, and co-workers may be flooded 

with many emotional reactions to a mental illness. The ill person may seem to change in personality, bringing a sense of loss, aban- donment or grief to those nearby. Companions may feel resentful at the unfairness of it all. They may feel beside themselves with rage at what seems to be the ill person s selfishness or lack of responsive-

![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.044.png)

ness. Also shame and embarrassment can make everyone oversensi- ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.045.png)tive to the reactions and opinions of acquaintances and neighbours,  especially in tightly knit rural communities where there is no  shelter of anonymity. Waves of anxiety, sadness, or anger may arise  without warning and catch a companion unaware.  *At first I felt this* 

These reactions are quite natural. The best you can do is to ac- *initial, desperate* knowledge them and carry on. It helps to develop a slightly thick  *desire for diagnoses,* skin. Accept your own imperfections, and   even at this often un- *for medications, for* bearably stressful time   try to maintain a sense of humour.   *something, anything* Basically, the illness is not about you. You didn t cause it, and you  *to fix it. Eventually I* can t cure it. You can only help out along the way.  *calmed down.*  

That said, you will probably want to find help, not only to under-  **A COMPANION** stand your reactions but also to learn ways to deal with them. 

Keeping your balance

A companion usually has an ongoing relationship with the ill   person that will be the basis of how they will work together. Dif- ferent relationships imply different stresses on the companion. For  example:  

- a partner or spouse may need individual counselling to help them  deal with their own emotions such as anger, grief, and abandon- ment.  
- a parent or sibling may also feel guilt, or family shame, as well as  guardian responsibilities.  
- a close friend or relative or co-worker may feel distrusted or  excluded. ![ref5]

  And yet, in your particular case, none of these issues may come up. 

  Few companions have had previous experience that gives them 

  the knowledge and skills for dealing with someone with a mental illness. In the companion role, you have to balance caring respon- sibilities with your own well-being. Getting worn out undermines your effectiveness. So your need for personal time has actually gone up just when you have to give more attention to the ill person. ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.046.png)

  Here are some suggestions for keeping things in balance: 

- Give up some authority. Don’t try to decide everything by your- self. Let events and the ill person s wishes take the lead in decid- ing what is done. 
- Set boundaries. Figure out what you’re best at. Discuss with the ill person what you will and won t be responsible for. You can only do what you can. If there are things you don t want to do or even to talk about, say so. Researchers have found that getting people with a mental illness to do more for themselves improves their health. 
- Pace yourself. If you try to do everything all the time, you will become exhausted. (A jogger who runs too fast soon comes to a stop.) Mental illnesses can be unpredictable, and it will take a while to work out your role. 
- Respect your personal warning signs. If you find yourself being easily irritated, getting uncontrollably angry or crying unexpect- edly, feeling apathetic, suffering from headaches or tension, con- stipation or diarrhea, etc. you may need more sleep, some time away, or more help.
- Give yourself breaks. Carve out time for yourself as often as pos- sible (daily is great) to keep connected to your normal life. Take a walk, do yoga, spend time with friends, read a book, go to a movie   anything that lifts you away for a while to another men- tal space. 

  Getting support 

  As companion you have to deal with two extraordinary situations, the ill person s and your own. You should not expect to do all of this by yourself. Probably you can t. But if you have been condi- tioned to handle problems on your own, it s hard to imagine reach- ing out to others at such a vulnerable time. 

  You may also have to deal with the ill person s worries about oth- ers knowing of their illness. If that s the case, talk to them about 

the people they would trust to know. The ill person s insistence on  ![ref2]privacy (or secrecy) cannot be allowed to curtail your life. In the  end, this support is for you, not for the ill person   as they usually  understand if you explain it.  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.047.png)

` `*Don t be shy about* Task assistance *letting people help.*  

Here is a strategy that might help with practical support:   **A COMPANION**

- Figure out specific tasks that others could do for you (grocery  shopping, dog walking, a meal a week, sitting in the house while  you go off for an hour or two). The more specific the task, the  easier it is for someone to sign on, and perhaps for the ill person  to accept. 
- First approach any friends who have already offered to help.  Then try the others. Always remember: no one has an obligation  to help. If they do not want to become involved, respect their  feelings. It does not mean they are not your friends.  

You ll probably be surprised how many friends will be willing to  perform certain regular and clearly defined tasks.  

Support groups and counselling  

A lot of attention goes to the person with the mental illness. As a  companion you may deny or minimize your own difficulties. To  you, perhaps, your problems do not compare to those of the ill   person. That doesn t mean they don t require your attention. To  admit to everything that you are feeling does not mean you are  becoming  clinically depressed.  It means you re healthy enough  to realize you need help to keep things in perspective. As with the  *I ve decided  it* mentally ill person, seeking help is a wise thing to do.  *takes a village  to* 

In the same way that the ill person can benefit greatly from peer  *help someone with a* support groups and personal therapy or counselling, so too can  *mental illness.*  you. As with the ill person, it may take some courage and determi-

nation for you to reach out for yourself in this way, and some shop-  **A COMPANION** ping around may be needed to find the right fit. But many people 

who have been, or still are, companions say this kind of backup be-

came exceedingly valuable for their own stability and state of mind. 

Indeed, in our interviews, they often urged other companions to 

proactively seek counselling or group support to keep themselves 

effective, whether they think they need it or not. 

There are two general categories of support groups of possible in- terest to a companion:  

- Family or companion support groups. Often run by profession- als in association with a hospital or clinic, these bring together  

**C A R I N G  F O R  Y O U R S E L F** 43

friends and family members in companion situations for sharing experiences, learning about mental illness and the health care system, counselling issues, and other relevant topics. This is an excellent way for companions to meet and help one another.![ref5]

- Peer support groups for people with mental illness. These groups, discussed earlier, sometimes encourage companions to attend along with the ill person. On one hand, this helps the ill person get over the hurdle of reaching out. On the other hand, it can be ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.048.png)

In Focus ![ref4]

A closer look at the people who will help and the  issues you may face in a mental illness. 

Who does what?  

Depending on the situation, a person with a mental illness may en- counter a variety of specialists on their treatment team. While their  functions seem to both differ and overlap confusingly, it helps to  distinguish between medical and management functions:  

Medical: Diagnosis and treatment  

Certain specialists focus on dealing with the illness itself:  

Psychiatrists: medical doctors with special training, they determine  diagnosis, treatment plans, and medications. Psychiatrists may pro- vide care directly or act as consultants to primary care physicians.  

Psychiatric nurses: often the first specialist contact, they conduct  preliminary assessments, support patients by administering medica- tions and monitoring, and help with transitions between home and  hospital.  

Clinical psychologists: may conduct testing to assess brain func- tions and disorders to refine diagnoses, set up treatment plans, pro- vide psychotherapy or counselling, and offer other services. 

Management: Management and recovery  

Other specialists help ill persons re-establish themselves and find  support systems in the community:  

Psychotherapists: provide counselling and other services designed  to promote recovery and build confidence and self-esteem. Many  mental health professionals provide psychotherapy. 

Occupational and recreational therapists: provide life skills training  (eg. using a kitchen, paying bills) to help manage daily   

routines and offer vocational assessment and strategies for work   re-integration.  

Social workers: do any of a variety of things such as counselling  or education, helping access community resources, working with  families, and case management.  

Case managers: co-ordinate the services received by an ill person   

**I N  F O C U S** 46

in the community. Often this co-ordinating role falls to the  companion. ![ref1]![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.049.png)

Stigma, fear, and discrimination

We are moving towards a world in which mental illness will come to be seen as either a curable disease or a controllable condition like forms of diabetes. But we aren t there yet. 

Old attitudes toward mental illness were based on ignorance and social fears. They involved the idea of  stigma,  which marked the ill person as someone to be avoided. But now, as people under- stand that mental illness is, in fact, just an illness, that attitude of avoidance is beginning to be seen as prejudice and discrimination. For example, many people fear an ill person will become violent, though the rate of violence is no different among those being treat- ed for mental illness than in the general population. However,  even as the old attitudes recede, the bias lingers in our language. People speak casually of persons  cracking up  and  going insane.  This ignorant prejudice does great harm to those suffering mental illness (and to the people around them) because of the kinds of fears it instils.

These fears are of two kinds: 

- Outward: where the ill person or close family members may fear losing face among family and friends, co-workers, and neigh- bours. The ill person may go to great lengths to keep the illness secret, to keep up appearances, or to withdraw into solitude.  
- Inward: where the perceived stigma of mental illness may cause the person to refuse to accept the fact that an illness is present and to deal with it. The ill person may avoid visiting the doctor, resist a diagnosis or work relentlessly to get a more favourable- sounding diagnosis, develop paranoid feelings about health pro- fessionals, abandon medications too soon or abruptly in a prema- ture belief they are getting better, and so on. This abhorrence of one s own condition builds a state of denial, which interferes with treatment and management. 

Both fears, often reinforcing one another, promote a kind of para- noid isolation and secrecy that may become important issues for the companion to deal with. The ill person may expect the com- panion to share these fears and go along with strategies of conceal- ment. This can place the companion in an awkward position: on one hand wishing to play along a bit to bolster the sense of trust and partnership but on the other hand hoping to inject some real-

**I N  F O C U S**


ity and combat paranoia. This can be a significant area for judg- ![ref4]

ment calls by the companion.  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.050.png)

` `*Dump your pride* A moderate strategy to allay these fears is to be calmly sceptical about them. It helps to remember that fears of what might happen  *and go for it. Set a* 

can be much harder on the ill person than dealing with something  *standard for others* if it does happen. Prejudices against mental illness are diminishing  *and ignore the* 

as people learn more about it, come to recognize how common it  *stigma.*  

is, and realize that it is a non-contagious disability to be managed   **A PARENT**

and lived with. 

Hospitalization 

For people with a mental illness, few things are as feared as a stay in  

hospital. And yet, having been so reluctant to enter hospital, many  

people with mental illness find the experience a great relief. They  

can finally stop trying to keep up appearances and struggling to  

manage their daily lives. A routine is set, with daily therapy groups  

to attend. They meet others with whom they can share experiences.  

The hospital becomes an area in which, unlike the home and outer  

world, the ill person feels safe and, eventually, confident. One com- 

panion said her ill son seemed to stand taller, as if a load had been  *The most useful* lifted from his shoulders. The experience becomes that of a way  *thing the hospital* station. As another companion said,  it was a short-haul stop for a  *told us was that the* long haul.  *patient is driving the*

and assessment, sometimes including detoxification. But the usual  *The resources will be* outcome of a visit to the emergency room, for mental illness as for  *tailored to you.*  

many physical illnesses, is discharge.   **A COMPANION**

Hospitalization gives diagnosis and treatment a jump start. The ill  

person can be closely monitored and assessed by a range of profes- 

sionals not just for a few hours but over several days. From the re- 

sults of the tests, the doctors can develop a treatment plan incorpo- 

rating the medical services needed   i.e. psychiatrist, group therapy,  *Once I got into* etc. As well, responses to medications can be followed carefully and  *hospital it was the* adjusted when necessary.  *best place for me to* To the companion, the hospital environment can seem forbidding  *be.

and institutional in its physical layout and equipment. Rooms   **A PERSON WITH A** are usually stripped down to the essentials, with no televisions or  **MENTAL ILLNESS** phones. But the barrenness may be a matter of indifference to the 

ill person. Many patients want family and friends to visit. Fre-

quent, brief visits are often best (sometimes twice a day). But some-

times an ill person may want visiting family members to meet their new friends and spend time with them. An advantage to having people visit in the hospital (if the patient wants it) is that it makes it easier for them to continue visiting later when the ill person has ![ref1]![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.051.png)

` `*I didn t mind if*  gone home.

`  `**A PERSON WITH A**  Soon enough it will be time for the ill person to come home. You **MENTAL ILLNESS**

can help with the transition. For example, you can encourage continued participation in hospital programs (where possible) for peer group support and perhaps visits to hospital friends still in the wards. Do not expect too much. A hospital stay is not a cure. But it does set up the ill person with a treatment plan on which they can start managing and recovering. 

Attempted suicide

One of the greatest fears for friends and family of a person with a mental illness is the possibility of a suicide attempt. A companion sometimes feels this issue is the elephant in the room that no one talks about. But an ill person, feeling so desperate and full of pain 

that they can no longer cope, may see it as an option, a relief of last  *People*  resort, or may experience it as a very powerful impulse. 

*contemplating*  If you encounter an attempted suicide, here s what to do: 

*suicide aren t being*  • Call 911 for help. The first person to arrive at your door may be *selfish. They just*  a police officer, a firefighter, or a paramedic. The ill person will *can t handle the*  usually be taken to an emergency room for a short involuntary *pain.*   hospitalization. Medical personnel have a brief, legally deter-

mined period of time to decide if the patient can safely be dis-

`  `**A PMENTERSON AL ILLNESSWITH A**  charged. If continued involuntary hospitalization is called for, or 

if any treatment is proposed, the usual patient s rights procedures apply. (See Patient s rights, page 35.) 

- If you suspect a drug overdose and you accompany the ill person to the hospital, take the bottle so the doctors will know what was taken. If you ve got an up-to-date list of the medications the ill person is currently taking, that s helpful too.
- At the hospital, you’ll do the checking in with the triage nurse while the doctors attend to the patient. You will be asked many questions by various people. This can be exhausting but try to be patient and answer as fully as you can. They re just trying to find out what happened.

![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.052.png)

For the companion, an attempted suicide (and, even more so, a  ![ref4]successful attempt) has a special hazard of its own: blaming your- self. The companion more than anyone else will see in retrospect  so many  if onlys.  But even though it s almost impossible not to  blame yourself, there is no point in thinking that if you had some- how been more attentive you might have prevented the attempt.  One thing on which everyone in the mental health community  seems to agree is that while this sense of blame is understandable,  often unavoidable, it is certainly mistaken. No matter how vigilant  a companion is, a person who is intent on attempting suicide will  find a way and a time to try. What happened is not your fault,  though at first and for a while you may think it was. You were only  a companion. You were not in the driver s seat.    

Patient’s rights 

A companion may encounter a couple of areas of concern for  patient s rights in the field of mental illness. The questions are  whether an ill person can be (1) hospitalized or (2) treated against  their will and over their objections. Although the two are related,  they are often dealt with separately in the health care system. In  both cases, across Canada, the short answer is: Yes, these things can  happen, provided certain strict legal conditions are fulfilled.  

The legal conditions and procedures vary by province. A compan- ion encountering this issue will therefore have to begin by ascer- taining the requirements for their jurisdiction. An efficient way  to do this is by contacting the local office of the Canadian Mental  Health Association. To find this office one can go to the CMHA  web site: www.cmha.ca. (Readers lacking a computer can talk to  the librarian at the local public library.)   

The following points seem to be typical practice across Canada:  

- Because of the Charter of Rights, any legislation that enables  

**I N  F O C U S** 52

removing of Canadian rights (as is done with compulsory hospi- talization) must also incorporate criteria and procedures by which these rights can be reinstated. Therefore, health care systems that allow involuntary hospitalization or treatment must give these patients access to legal advice and to appeal procedures and cri- teria that, if satisfied, will overturn the order and enable them to leave the hospital. ![ref1]![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.053.png)

- The certificate ordering hospitalization or treatment must be  authorized by the signature of one or more medical doctors. An exception may be when the police take into custody someone with a mental illness and bring them to the hospital or when there is an initial short period of assessment (often up to 72 hours) ordered by a judge or justice of the peace. If an involun- tary patient is judged incapable of rational decision, a companion might be asked to act as a substitute decision-maker to give per- mission for treatment.
- Hospitals generally post an explanation of patient’s rights where it can be seen and read. Whenever a person is placed in hospital without their consent, it is usual for them to be visited promptly by a paralegal or patient s rights advocate and informed of their rights to appeal and to receive legal assistance. 
- Involuntary hospitalization is not indefinite but involves stated intervals and appeal procedures that are legally defined. 

  Nevertheless, a companion cannot promise an ill person that if they visit a doctor or hospital voluntarily they will always be able to walk out when they wish. The companion must keep this in mind if trying to reassure an ill person s fears.

  Medications and side effects 

  One of the biggest changes in mental health care has been the development of psychiatric medication. It has allowed fewer and shorter hospital stays and a faster return to independent living. The importance of this revolution in medication for people with mental illness is huge: in many cases, it has meant they can carry on with their lives in a meaningful way. 

  Side effects remain a central problem, though gradually diminish- ing with new generations of drugs. A person taking psychiatric medications may feel dull or drugged or nauseated, put on weight, sweat profusely, become impotent, or suffer from diarrhea. The challenge for the psychiatrist is to find the drug (or combination of drugs) that brings the most benefit with the fewest problems for each patient. That, in fact, is a great deal of what psychiatrists do. 

At the outset, no one knows for sure which medications will work  ![ref4]best in any particular situation because people react differently to  them. That means a sometimes drawn-out process of trial and er- ror before the most effective drug (and the one with the fewest side  effects) is found. However, before the drug actually starts to do its  proper work (which may take weeks), the ill person will mainly be  aware only of the negative side effects. The ill person may even be  reluctant to accept the specific diagnoses and therefore refuse to  take the medication. This can be a very disheartening time. So it s  important to offer moral support and reassurance about the treat- ment plan to someone who has just gone on medication. It s also  helpful to work with the ill person on recording signs and symp- toms and noting where progress is being made (or not). Many side  effects may diminish over the first few weeks of treatment. Peer  groups or counselling can also help sustain the ill person s commit- ment to the drug therapy.  

There is a second part to this story that s even more important to  the companion. Just as the side effects generally tend to appear  before the benefits do, so they are usually the first to vanish when  the medication stops. When the medications are stopped, the side  effects tend to lift quickly and to be replaced by feelings of eupho- ria and recovery. It is tempting to believe that the illness is cured.  Don t be fooled. As the drug leaves the system, the illness begins to  reassert itself, in ways that the sick person may not at first realize.  That s one of the main reasons to stay on medication and make  changes only with medical supervision: going off medication great- ly increases the chance of relapse.  

Relapses  

When an acute episode of mental illness finally seems to be reced- ing, it is tempting to hope it is going away for good. It is hard to  imagine that a relapse may occur. However, many forms of mental  illness have a rhythm: acute phases separated by relatively quiet  times. This pattern, if recognized, can be used to help manage the  illness:  ![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.054.png)

- Use the quiet time to prepare for a possible relapse.

(As well, keep an up-to-date list of medi-  **A DOCTOR** cations handy.)
- When the acute phase recurs, focus on just getting by with as  much comfort as possible. Sometimes, in the middle of a bout of

- Afterwards, when quiet returns, go back to the activities you put on hold during the relapse. Try always to be ready for a recur- rence. If symptoms can be recognized in time, a relapse might be minimized or even prevented.![](Aspose.Words.17165bd2-238e-4401-a856-3afa17bb9132.055.png)

Afterword ![ref4]

This guide was written with a friend by a former companion who  has experienced the bewilderment and sense of aloneness that  comes from being suddenly on the spot during a mental health  crisis. We wanted to help others keep their footing, understand  the challenges they may face, and learn the things they could do to  help during this extraordinarily difficult time. Our idea was a guide  that could pass on advice from experienced companions to new  ones.  

Besides a wide range of companions, we interviewed many others  knowledgeable about mental illness: doctors, psychiatric nurses,  case workers, directors of community health organizations, and  people with mental illnesses themselves. We thank them all for  their honesty and candour. 

We were struck by the difference in perspective between health care  professionals, who deal with large numbers of people and illnesses,  and companions, who have dealt with only one ill person, but  

that one far more fully and closely than a professional ever could.  Professional health workers have broad experience and vast sets of  data, many ways of sharing their knowledge, and specialized medi- cal vocabularies. Companions have had no experience, few ways of  sharing or even meeting, and no sense of how they can fit into the  process and help. Until now, companions have been fundamentally  isolated. We hoped that a guide like this could help reduce this iso- lation   in part by showing the importance of their role and giving  it a name, that of  companion.   

We were also struck by the strength and diversity of local mental  health communities. These communities are made up of all the  people involved with mental illness: health care professionals, ill  persons, companions, organizations, agencies. They work together,  know one another, and are able to offer support and advice to the  newcomer. The road for a companion can be a solitary one, but it  doesn t have to be. One of the best pathways out of isolation is to  connect up with this community in your area.  

Finally, we found there is no simple set of rules, no recipe for suc- cess as a companion. No sooner would we begin to think we had  something like this than we would speak to one or two people who  completely disagreed. We realized that each companion s situation  has aspects in common with others but as a whole is unique. So the

suggestions in this booklet are no more than that. At best, they are true in most cases, most of the time. But we hope that reading this guide will help to reduce the drama and trauma that so often add to the burden of mental illness. ![ref4]

At the end of the day, what you as a companion will come to rely on is your own best judgment. No one else knows your situation as you do. But perhaps you ll find courage from learning here that others have been in similar situations and found ways of dealing with them.

More comments from mental health professionals and others:

At a time when health care dollars are being stretched to past the breaking point, this piece promotes the development of healthy support systems for our clients. In the future, there will be increasing pressure for families and companions to be more involved, and this guide will be invaluable.

People at their first contact with the mental health treatment system often feel numb, fearful, confused, disorganized, vulnerable, quick to anger, or any combination of these emotions. Just when they most want to be a calm and effective advocate for their loved one, they don t know how to navigate in this unfamiliar world. With this booklet as their guide, they will be able to act compassionately and in the best interest of their friend or relative. These writers clarify and make sense of a very difficult time.

What mental health professionals and others say about this guide:

This guide is the single best resource I have read for those people who care for and about someone with a mental illness. In plain language, it describes all those pragmatic and personal issues that can be all too easily overlooked or forgotten in the heat of the moment, be it in an emergency room, a doctor s office, or at home.
